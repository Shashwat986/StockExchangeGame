# Stock Exchange Game

This is my attempt at recreating the [Zephyr Stock Exchange Board Game](https://zephyrtoys.com/collections/games/products/stock-exchange-board-game). I'm trying for a more customizable experience in this, and I want to introduce more 'controlled' randomness.

## Stack

I'm also using this project to learn the following tools:

* [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/)
* [Material Design](https://material.google.com/) using [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/)

## Running

To run this on your local machine,

`$ python main.py`

This command takes two optional parameters: `port` (default `ENV['PORT']` or `8888`) and `debug` (default `False`)

## Next Steps

* Build the game
* Port it to iOS and Android
* ???
* Win!
